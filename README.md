# Waste-To-Wellness
Problem Statement
Food waste is a significant global issue that not only contributes to environmental degradation but also exacerbates the problem of food insecurity. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, approximately one-third of all food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted each year. At the same time, millions of people around the world suffer from hunger and lack access to nutritious food.

Solution
Our platform provides a proactive approach to food recycling by leveraging technology and collaboration. Here's how it works:

Efficient Collection: We partner with marriage halls, restaurants, parties, and other food suppliers to collect surplus food before it goes to waste. Our team ensures that the collection process is streamlined, time-sensitive, and adheres to safety and hygiene standards.

Connecting Food Suppliers and Organizations: We connect food suppliers with local organizations dedicated to combating food insecurity, such as shelters, food banks, and community centers. By facilitating this connection, we ensure that the surplus food collected reaches those who need it the most.

Minimizing Methane Gas Production: Food waste that ends up in landfills produces methane gas, a potent greenhouse gas contributing to climate change. By effectively managing food waste through our platform, we reduce methane gas production and contribute to a greener and more sustainable future.

Women-Led Initiative: Our initiative is led by women, recognizing their pivotal role in driving change and fostering sustainability. We empower women's communities by involving them in every aspect of the platform's implementation, from collection to distribution. This not only provides economic opportunities but also contributes to gender equality and social empowerment.

Key Features
Efficient Collection: Our platform streamlines the process of collecting surplus food from various sources, ensuring timely and effective collection.

Collaboration: We foster collaboration between food suppliers and local organizations dedicated to combating food insecurity, creating a network that efficiently redistributes surplus food.

Technological Integration: We leverage technology, including web and mobile applications, to facilitate the seamless operation of the platform, making it easy for food suppliers and organizations to participate.

Location-Based Services: We utilize the Google Maps API to provide location-based services, enabling efficient routing and tracking of food collection and distribution.

Communication: The platform incorporates SMS notifications and communication features, powered by the Twilio API, to enhance coordination and ensure timely delivery of surplus food.

Data Management: We utilize a PostgreSQL database to securely store and manage data related to food suppliers, organizations, and collection/distribution logistics.

Future Goals
Scaling Impact: We aim to expand the Food Recycling Platform to other regions and communities, maximizing our impact in addressing food waste and food insecurity on a broader scale.

Community Engagement: We strive to actively engage local communities through awareness campaigns, educational initiatives, and involvement in the food recycling process, fostering a sense of ownership and sustainability.

Partnerships: We seek to forge partnerships with government agencies, non-profit organizations, and corporate entities to strengthen our platform and create a sustainable ecosystem that addresses food waste and food insecurity.
